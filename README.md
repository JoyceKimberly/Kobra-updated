# Kobra-updated

I've been bringing the firmware for the Kobra up to date with Marlin as much as possible, however this has now reached the point where people with more knowledge on the subject need to go over it.
It compiles and runs on my Kobra successfully, but I lack the experience to make the final changes to HAL and take any other changed out of Marlin and into the lib folder so new Marlin changes can simply be dropped in.

With many thanks to
